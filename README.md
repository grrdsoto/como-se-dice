# ¿Cómo se dice?
Challenge your language skill with our little jueguito (game). 

## What is ¿Cómo se dice?
This is a web game that will challenge and test your multi-language brain by asking you to translate an english word into spanish. 
Right now, the game offers 2 different game modes, Normal game mode and Timed game mode. We are hoping to add more game modes and 
allow you to create your own account so you can keep track of your progress and see how you match up against those around you, as 
we scale the web game. We plan to add a daily challenge mode and multiplayer so you can play with your friends, so stay tuned!

## Normal game mode
Normal game mode has strict rules, you have to translate 10 words correctly, however, the catch is that you have 3 lives, meaning 
you can only miss 3 words before it's game over.

## Timed game mode
Timed game mode is exactly as it sounds, you have 60 seconds to see how many words you can translate.

## How to play?
We plan on publishing this web game in the future, but we are not there yet. But do not worry, you can still play this locally. All 
you have to do is clone this repo. We are using `react` for the front end and `nodejs` and `express` for the backend. The react side 
is in the `client` folder and the server side is in the `server` folder. To get both of these up and running, all you have to do is 
open two terminals, in one terminal `cd` into the `client` folder and run `npm start`, and in the other terminal `cd` into the `server` 
folder and run `npm run start`. This should start up the react project in `http://localhost:3000` and the server in `http://localhost:3001`. 
Then you should see the landing page with the `play` button. Hit `play`, start playing and have fun!
